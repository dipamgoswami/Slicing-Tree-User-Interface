# Slicing-Tree-User-Interface

The objective of the project is to develop a user-interactive interface which enables the user to give a slicing tree as input by giving the dimensions of the rooms and the slicing type (Horizontal or Vertical) of the blocks. The interface will produce the slicing floor plan corresponding to the given slicing tree. 

The algorithm for the GUI development is implemented using Python programming language. This algorithm will be useful in any papers which are applicable only for slicing floor plans, to ensure that the user is giving a slicing floor plan as an input.
